The project is to classify passersby from photos using the Linear SVM + HOG features. One of the publicly available datasets: inria pedestian, daimler pedestrian etc.
The project should use scikit-image and scikit-learn.


Blog post:
* Introduction to HOG (histogram of oriented gradients)
* HOG Imagery example - image with calculated values ​​like http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/features_detection/plot_hog.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-features-detection-plot-hog-py
* Briefly describe the data set
* Mention the SVM algorithm, without a long translation give 3 links to other SVM sites
* Description of the project (code) - what is the workout, what are the lines of code, code mixed with comments describing what is doing


Project:
* Code in python and scikitlearn, scikit-image (not in opencv)
* Hog'i calculation code for images
* Apply Non-Maximum Suppression to select the final best window
* Code using linear SVM to learn the model (sliding window technique) (divide the collection into test and train, add a reasonable number of images to the collection set so that the model does not count for too long and to give reasonable results)
* Code displaying classification results on a test set
* Make a 600 character readme.md file describing the design (it should be nicely described and divided into sections, it should contain min 4 links to external material that may be helpful for further study
* The project should be logically divided into files
* Code should be abundantly commnted
